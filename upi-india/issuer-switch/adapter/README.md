# Google Cloud Issuer Switch - Bank Adapter APIs

Bank Adapter developers can use the proto files to generate an OpenAPI spec and
subsequently use that for their development of bank adapter APIs.
They can also use the Postman collection for testing their implementation.

Please note that the data used for fields like IFSC, account numbers, mobile numbers, etc. in the 
postman collection is purely for testing purposes and does not represent any real values.
