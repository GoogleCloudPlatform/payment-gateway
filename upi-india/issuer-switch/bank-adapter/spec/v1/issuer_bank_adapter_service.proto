  // **Note**: *Implementation of this Bank Adapter API is optional. Implement

  //
  // Payment settlements done using the Bank Adapter service might fail because
  // of various reasons such as time-out of the [SettlePayment][] API or network
  // failure. In the event of such a failure, the Issuer Switch does not receive
  // the final status of the payment settlement. To handle unresolved payments,
  // you can configure the Issuer Switch in either `Search & Settle` or `Resolve
  // Payment` mode.
  //
  // * `Search & Settle` - This is the default configuration of the Issuer
  // Switch. In this mode, the Issuer Switch handles the orchestration using the
  // [SearchPayments][] API to obtain the status of a payment settlement, and
  // based on the state of the payment, it invokes the [SettlePayment][] API to
  // settle the payments.
  // * `Resolve Payment` - In this mode the Issuer Switch delegates the task of
  // checking the current status of a payment settlement and its possible
  // re-execution to the bank adapter service / bank's core services. Use this
  // mode if your bank wants to handle the unresolved payments all by itself. To
  // enable this mode, you must implement the [ResolvePayment][] API. If the
  // Issuer Switch is configured in this mode, then the [ResolvePayment][] API
  // is invoked for all the unresolved transactions.
  //
  // Based on the NPCI request, the Issuer Switch invokes the [ResolvePayment][]
  // API to resolve the payment settlement transaction and obtain its final
  // status. This API is invoked to resolve a unresolved payment settlement of
  // the following types:
  //
  // * Debit Reversal
  // * Credit
  //
  // **Note:** The Issuer Switch will not invoke this API if the final status of
  // the payment settlement operation is already available with it.
  //
  // If the bank adapter service attempts to resolve the payment, but is unable
  // to resolve it successfully, then this API must return a HTTP status of 200
  // with the ResolvePaymentResponse containing [ResolutionStatus][] as FAILED
  // and the appropriate error code in [ResolvePaymentResult][]. Specifically, a
  // non-200 HTTP status must be returned only when the bank adapter service
  // itself fails and not when the resolution of the payment settlement fails.
  //
  // The [ErrorReason][] values that are allowed in the
  // [PaymentAdjustmentError][] in the [ResolvePaymentResult][] are:
  //
  //  * `ACCT_INACTIVE` = Indicates that the payer account is inactive, if the
  // settlement request is for a _debit reversal_ or that the payee account is
  // inactive, if the settlement request is for a _credit_.
  //
  // * `ACCT_FROZEN` = Indicates that the payer account is frozen, if the
  // settlement request is for a _debit reversal_ or that the payee account is
  // frozen, if the settlement request is for a _credit_.
  //
  // * `UNABLE_TO_UPDATE_BANK_SERVICES` = Indicates that the bank adapter
  // service could not update the bank's services.
  //
  // * `PARTY_INSTRUCTIONS` = Indicates that the resolution of the payment
  // failed due to party instructions.
  //
  // * `DUPLICATE_PROCESSING` = Indicates that the resolution request is a
  // duplicate.
  //
  // * `PAYMENT_UDIR_RET_114` = Indicates that the resolution failed due to
  // error `114` as part of beneficiary bank attempting to resolve a `TCC`
  // case.
  //
  // * `PAYMENT_UDIR_RET_115` = Indicates that the resolution failed due to
  // error `115` as part of beneficiary bank attempting to resolve a `TCC`
  // case.
  //
  // * `PAYMENT_UDIR_RET_116` = Indicates that the resolution failed due to
  // error `116` as part of beneficiary bank attempting to resolve a `TCC`
  // case.
  //
  // * `PAYMENT_UDIR_RET_117` = Indicates that the resolution failed due to
  // error `117` as part of beneficiary bank attempting to resolve a `TCC`
  // case.
  //
  // * `PAYMENT_UDIR_RET_118` = Indicates that the resolution failed due to
